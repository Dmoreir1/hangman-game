# Hangman

#### Your objective is to create the game hangman using Python
This will test your knowledge of python fundamentals and programming skills.

To get started, create a file named `hangman.py` and begin Pseudo-coding or whiteboarding an approach to this game. I suggest starting with a whiteboard or pen & paper to plan an approach. If you are feeling lost, I suggest playing a game or two of hangman on pen & paper and developing an algorithm as a player. Then with this insight, designing the game should become easier.

You do not need more than one file to build this game with Python. We will use the terminal for our visual output - no web browser/GUI.

The game should display in the terminal like so:

![Hangman in the terminal pt. 1](/assets/hangman_terminal_1.png)

- Hangman in the terminal - beginning of game.

![Hangman in the terminal pt. 2](/assets/hangman_terminal_2.png)

- Hangman in the terminal - end of game, displays result.
